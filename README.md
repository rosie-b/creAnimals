# creAnimals

A place to create a gallery of weird new animals, by mashing existing animals together.

# User Stories (MVP)
As a user, I can see a gallery of creatures that are a combination of other animals mashed together. 

As a user, I can select a creature from the gallery and view it's profile As a user, I can view a creature's profile and will see it's name, image, click to hear the sound it makes, read about it's characteristics/likes/dislikes, diet, habitat. 

As a user, I can create my own creature and assign the details of it's profile. 

As a user, I can view my newly created creature in the main gallery.

# User Stories (Stretch Goals)
As a user, I can record my own sound when creating a creature (MVP is to select from a drop down of options only) 

As a user, I enter my name into the profile when creating a creature, so that seaches can be performed on the main gallery to filter on those created by specific users. 

As a user, I can select two profiles to mash together, which will randomly assign features from each profile to create a whole new creature.
